        <h1 class="intro">Here are a couple of things I like to do in my spare time when im not coding.</h1>
        <section class="games">
            <h2>Gaming</h2>

            <p>I have been gaming since i was around 6 years old on a SNES and Sega Genesis. I had many other relatives, younger and older, to play games with. Those include my younger cousins, my aunt, and my step father. I played all kinds of different genres of games from board game, Tabletop Rpg games and of course video games.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite genres of games are RPG, fighting games, and puzzle adventure games. Role Playing Games, or RPG for short, let me experience a very rich and detailed story that is similar to an epic fiction novel but also experience the action. It brings to life things that I would have had to imagine if this was in a book i would read.</p>
            <p>I enjoy fighting games because i have a deeply competitive side to me when playing games and a game that pits me against one other person is very exciting to me. There is no luck or 'rng' involved in a fighting game and no other team mates that can lose you the match. It's entirely up to you. There is also a varied cast of characters in a fighting game from multiple different backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Last but certainly not least are Puzzle Adventure games. These games are usually about you playing a specific character and traveling through locations solving all kinds of puzzles. I like these games because it stimulates my brain to solve the different types of puzzles. It adds more depth then some mindless game where you just move and attack whoever shows up in front of you. A lot of times there arent any enemies in the game at all.</p>

        <section class="reading">
            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <img class="book" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQbnIs3Je65uNzXMKgZr-no4GUdB-_rV55xfg&usqp=CAU"/>
            <p>Another thing i like to do is reading books. Whether it is ebooks, audio books, or traditional paper books. My favorite genre is fantasy but i do enjoy some mystery or sci-fi stories occasionally. I also prefer long epic novels that take multiple books to tell its story. Some of my favorite series include The Lord of the Rings, The Sword of Ice and Fire, and The Wheel of Time.</p>
