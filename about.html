            <p>I have been gaming since i was around 6 years old on a SNES and Sega Genesis. I had many other relatives, younger and older, to play games with. Those include my younger cousins, my aunt, and my step father. I played all kinds of different genres of games from board game, Tabletop Rpg games and of course video games.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite genres of games are RPG, fighting games, and puzzle adventure games. Role Playing Games, or RPG for short, let me experience a very rich and detailed story that is similar to an epic fiction novel but also experience the action. It brings to life things that I would have had to imagine if this was in a book i would read.</p>
